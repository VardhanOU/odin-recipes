        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Sink your fork into warm, golden-brown slices of French toast—crispy on the outside, soft and custardy on the inside. Infused with hints of cinnamon and vanilla, then topped with a pat of butter and a drizzle of maple syrup, this breakfast favorite is both nostalgic and irresistible. Perfect for slow weekend mornings or an indulgent brunch.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices thick-cut bread</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of half-and half of whole milk and cream</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Butter(preferably salted) for frying according to need</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: Maple syrup, powdered sugar, fresh berries, whipped cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a shallow bowl or pie dish, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, sugar, and salt until fully combined.</li>
            <li>Dip each slice of bread into the custard mixture, allowing it to soak for about 30 seconds per side (longer if the bread is thick or slightly stale).</li>
            <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add the butter and let it melt, swirling to coat the pan evenly.</li>
            <li>Add the soaked bread slices to the skillet. Cook the bread throughout for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and slightly crispy. Adjust the heat as needed to avoid burning.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with your favorite toppings—classics like maple syrup, powdered sugar and butter, or go fancy with berries and whipped cream.</li>
        </ol>
