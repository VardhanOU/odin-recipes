            <li>200g (7 oz) fettuccine (or pasta of choice)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Pinch of ground nutmeg(optional)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (plus more for topping)</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Black pepper, freshly ground, to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish (optional)</li>
            <li>Optional add-ins: Grilled chicken, sautéed shrimp, or mushrooms</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, then drain.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, then add garlic and sauté for 30-60 seconds until fragrant (do not brown).</li>
            <li>Pour in the heavy cream. Simmer for 2-3 minutes, stirring gently, until it begins to thicken slightly.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low. Slowly whisk in the Parmesan cheese until fully melted and smooth. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water.</li>
            <li>Toss the cooked pasta into the sauce until well coated. Simmer together for 1-2 minutes. Top with extra Parmesan and chopped parsley if desired.</li>
        </ol>
